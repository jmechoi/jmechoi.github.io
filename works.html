					<p>I enrolled in a short course from DesignLab to push my design skills and create a stronger foundation for my knowledge of design. Throughout the course, I worked on a project to create a design concept for a landing page for a travel/location website. After the stages of brainstorming, I decided to create a landing page for a location based app that would help users discover new things to do in their area of choice. I am planning to really focus in on creating a personable, and seamless interface that helps users achieve their goals easily, efficiently, and pleasantly.</p>

						<p class="text-center">
						This is the logo that I designed in Figma for my project. I played off the idea of the location pin icon to play off of the letter p (for peri) and also added movement with the curved lines. I went for a colors that were lighthearted and fun to go along with the feelings/theme of excitement for discovering new things.

						Through the process of mind mapping, creating POVs, How Might We's, and features, I was able to create the very beginnings for my idea for my Design 101 project.

					<h3>Embrace Ministry Summer Retreat Booklet</h3>

						<p class="text-center">
						I had a lot of fun designing the cover for this retreat booklet. The retreat's theme was "True Righteousness". I decided on a dark background with a big, handwritten font for the title that would easily bring the eyes immediately to it (with an emphasis on "True"). I was really happy with how the schedule turned out on the back cover and wanted to make it as easy as possible for the audience to know when and where to be during the retreat. I used vibrant colors and cute, rounded boxes to catch the eye and bring a little fun into something that could be really boring to look at.

						<p class="text-center">
						All inside pages were printed in black and white. The first page reintroduces the theme of the retreat and reveals the theme Bible verse. I chose to keep the design very simple and clean - no distractions to the focus (which is the content).

						<p class="text-center">
						These are a sample of the inside pages that made up the rest of the booklet. These booklets would get a lot of use for writing notes throughout the retreat. I designed this booklet to have a lot of open space so that the audience would be able to have plenty of room to write, and in however way they want. I used my own past experiences of feeling constrained with wide-ruled note pages and left the main note-taking pages very open and almost blank. A lot of times it's hard to hear and/or remember the passages that the speaker speaks on - so I also added a small box that clearly states the passage. I also paid attention to the type of paper and made sure that it feels nice to write on, and would be smudge free.

The meaning of "Meraki" is beautiful and wanted to make sure that they make that connection with their audience when they first land at the website. I decided to keep the design simple and intuitive so that their potential clients will be drawn to starting a conversation them.
